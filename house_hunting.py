- Retrieve user input. Look at `input()` if you need help with getting user input. For this problem set, you can assume that users will enter valid input (e.g. they wonâ€™t enter a string when you expect a number.)
- Initialize some state variables. You should decide what information you need. Be careful about values that represent annual amounts and those that represent monthly amounts.
- Try different inputs and see how long it takes to save for a down payment.
